    <p>Hi, I am a 14-year-old Canadian high school student.
      I have been coding since I was twelve, starting out with C# with the Unity framework, then learning HTML paired with CSS, and now I am trying to master JS
      I am currently in a school programme focused on digital arts and design, which is helping me become a better frontend developer. </p>
